# Building Maintenance Coordinator · LABDSOF 26/27

**BMC** is a proposed platform to help condominium administrators and residents coordinate faults: from the first report through intervention and closure, with traceable information and AI-assisted triage.

**Current stage: Sprint 1 — discovery, validation and design.** The repository contains planning documentation and templates. **It does not yet contain an application, software tests, CI/CD or executable deployment.**

## Start here

1. Read the [assignment](LABDSOF-26-27-Assignment.md).
2. Learn about the [strategy](documents/building-maintenance-coordinator-strategy.md) and [vision/scope](documents/04-product-vision.md).
3. Consult the [Sprint 1 plan](documents/planning/sprint-1-plan.md), [backlog](documents/06-product-backlog.md) and [pending decisions](documents/planning/decisions-and-feedback.md).
4. To contribute, use the [team working agreement](documents/governance/team-working-agreement.md), [DoR](documents/governance/definition-of-ready.md), [DoD](documents/governance/definition-of-done.md) and [Git workflow](documents/governance/git-workflow.md).

## Proposed product

**Report → review triage → select contractor → approve request → obtain acceptance → confirm booking → execute → close.**

- Community: residential condominiums in Portugal.
- Proposed primary user: professional administrator; residents and contractors participate in the workflow.
- Outcome to investigate: reduce the administrator's active coordination time.
- AI: correctable suggestions, with a non-AI baseline and fallback; actions approved by the authorised user.
- Proposed MVP: text, small catalogue, one notification channel, calendar/simulator, states and history.
- Post-MVP: photos, cost analytics and narrative summaries.
- **IoT remains undecided**; it is not automatically included in the MVP baseline.

## How to interpret statuses

**Draft/proposal** = written but not validated. **Plan/template** = a way to perform/record work, not proof of execution. **Completed/verified** requires evidence (PR, result, configuration or session). Checked boxes below refer only to what they explicitly describe.

**Last documentation review:** 2026-10-07. Team review and ratification pending. Documentation prepared with AI assistance; claims, choices and results require human review and evidence.

## Sprint 1 phase progress

### Phase 1 — organisation · partial

- [x] Local Git repository available.
- [x] Documented proposals for methodology, DoR/DoD, Git and tracking.
- [x] Local collaboration templates prepared.
- [ ] Verify remote, access, main branch and protections.
- [ ] Choose/configure board, labels, milestones and issues.
- [ ] Ratify methodology/DoR/DoD and assign roles.
- [ ] Confirm dates, capacity and the meaning of Sprint B.

### Phase 2 — discovery · documentation preparation

- [x] Problem, hypotheses and research guides written.
- [x] Proposed initial list of features and NFRs.
- [ ] Complete domain research and competitor sources.
- [ ] Perform elicitation and record evidence/limitations.
- [ ] Update requirements and decisions based on findings.

### Phase 3 — scope and backlog · proposal

- [x] Vision, provisional personas, journeys, epics and conceptual model.
- [x] Backlog with criteria and proposed MoSCoW priorities.
- [x] Candidates and DoR gate for Sprint B.
- [ ] Discuss priorities with the customer/lecturers and record changes.
- [ ] Estimate, assign owners and select only Ready items.
- [ ] Consolidate architecture, AI, security and ADRs.
- [ ] Implement and demonstrate the walking skeleton with build/tests/containers.
- [ ] Record actual feedback and track the decision revision required by §5.7.

## Priority decisions

DEC-01: scope and IoT; DEC-03: team/schedule/Sprint B; DEC-04: stack and architecture; DEC-07: access and data; DEC-09: process/board; DEC-10: intervention rules. Other questions and participants are in the [register](documents/planning/decisions-and-feedback.md).

**Next team session:** ratify organisation, assign owners and prepare research/decisions for planning. Phases can run in parallel without declaring research complete before it has taken place.

## Run the project

There is no application to run yet. The [walking skeleton plan](documents/10-walking-skeleton.md) defines the first demonstration and fields where actual commands, environment and evidence will be added after implementation.
